                I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was a stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. 
                His eye would trouble me no more.If you still think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. 
                The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.  
I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could have detected anything wrong.  
When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o’clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart—for what had I now to fear? 
There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they had been deputed to search the premises.
