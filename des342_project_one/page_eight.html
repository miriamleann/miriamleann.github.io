                    I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was a stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. 
                </p>

                 &nbsp;

                <p>His eye would trouble me no more.</p> &nbsp; <br>
                    
                <p>If you still think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body.

               <p>The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.  





              </p>
               &nbsp; 
                  
              <p>I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could have detected anything wrong.  


              </p>
            
              &nbsp;
              <p>When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o’clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart—for what had I now to fear? 

            </p>
            &nbsp;
            
            
            <p>There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they had been deputed to search the premises.
