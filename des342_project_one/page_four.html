                 <p>And this I did for seven long nights—every night just at midnight—but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his 
                  Evil Eye.
                  
                </p>
                 &nbsp;
                <p>Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine.  

                </p>
                &nbsp;
                  
               <p>I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts.

              </p>
               &nbsp; 
                  
              <p>I fairly chuckled at the idea;  and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if 
                startled. 
              </p>
            
              &nbsp;
              <p>Now you may think that I drew back—but no. His room was as black as pitch with thick darkness for the shutters were close fastened and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.
