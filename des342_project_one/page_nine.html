                    I smiled—for what had I now to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country.  I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search—search well. 

                </p>

                <p>I led them at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed.

                <p>In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim. 
                </p>

               <p>The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things.   





              </p>
               &nbsp; 
                  
              <p>But ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:— it continued and I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness—until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.
