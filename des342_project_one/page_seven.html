                 <p>It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!—do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror.
                </p>
                 &nbsp;
                <p>Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. &nbsp; <br>
                    
                <p>But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbor! </p>
                     &nbsp;
 

                </p>
               
                  
               <p>The old man’s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once—once only. 





              </p>
               &nbsp; 
                  
              <p>In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. 


              </p>
            
              &nbsp;
              <p>At length it ceased. The old man was dead. 

            </p>
