                <div1><h2 style="color:red;">
                 <p>I resolved to open a little—a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it—until, at length a single dim ray, like the thread of a spider, shot from out of the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye.
                </p>
                 &nbsp;
                <p>It was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—a dull blue,
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man’s face or person:
                    &nbsp; <br>
                    <br>
                     <p>for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot. </p>
                     &nbsp;
 

                </p>
               
                  
               <p>Now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.




              </p>
               &nbsp; 
                  
              <p>I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. 

              </p>
            
              &nbsp;
              <p>The hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant.

            </p>
            &nbsp;
            
            <p>The old man’s terror must have been extreme!
