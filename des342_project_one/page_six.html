                I resolved to open a little—a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it—until, at length a single dim ray, like the thread of a spider, shot from out of the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye.
                It was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—a dull blue,
                  with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man’s face or person:
                    for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot. </p>
                Now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.
I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. 
The hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant.
The old man’s terror must have been extreme!
