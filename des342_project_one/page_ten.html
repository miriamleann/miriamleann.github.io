                 No doubt I now grew very pale;—but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased—and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound much a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.
I gasped for breath—and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly—more vehementlyl but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. 
Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of men—but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! What could I do?
It grew louder—louder—louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!—no, no! They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery of my horror!—this I thought, and this I think. 
   But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!—and now—again!—hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!
“Villians!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the deed!—tear up the planks! here! here!—it is the beating of his hideous heart!”
