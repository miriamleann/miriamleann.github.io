                 <p>Now this is the point. You fancy me mad.
                Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me.
                You should have seen how wisely I proceeded—with what caution—with what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to work!
                I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him... 
                And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh, so gently! 
                And then, when my head was well in the room , I undid the lantern cautiously— cautiously (for the hinges creaked)— I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye.
