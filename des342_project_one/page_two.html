                 <p>It is impossible to say how the first idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night.
                </p>
                 &nbsp;
                <p>Object there was none. Passion there was none. </p>

               <p>I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. 
              </p>
               &nbsp; 
                  
              <p>I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture—a pale blue eye, with a film over it. 
              </p>
            
              &nbsp;
              <p>Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees—very gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
