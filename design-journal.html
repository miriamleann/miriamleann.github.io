        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: Ever since the days of Myspace, where I would have a blast changing my background, making my photos scroll across the screen, prompting snowflakes to fall and music to start playing, I have been inspired to get into learning how to code and learn html/css and just anything/ everything relevant to building and designing websites. I'm interested to know more about the difference of ux design compared to ui design and where the type of coding we are learning right now falls in. I am excited for this class and already having a lot of fun. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project one I am planning on creating five webpages related to astrology. I have an interest in the subject that goes deeper than sun sign astrology and I just think it's a really great tool for self discovery, reflection and growth. I am making the main web page be the title page of 'Astrology' with four links to the four webpages I will create that will be 1. Signs, 2. Houses, 3. Planets, and 4. Elements. I am also planning on linking a site where you can enter your birth information into a birth chart calculator to get your birth chart (a snapshot of the sky at the moment you were born) and that will be on the main webpage. On each of the webpages there will be short and concise descriptions of whatever that page is covering- so all the signs, all the planets, all the houses, all of the elements, as well as a short description of what each of them mean for your birth chart. I'm having a little difficulty making all the pages unique looking from one another, since they're mostly about relaying information and theres a good amount of it. I will try to play around with color and make the pages unique in that regard. I am going to be incorporating some starry space images to tie together with the stars and sky vibe and I am looking for a clean sans serif font that has a almost futuristic type vibe- as I feel that the idea of space conjures up ideas of the future and the unknown and I think astrology fits into that realm.   </p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
        <p>Response: The person who visits my site wants to learn more about astrology because they’re drawn to the occult and the unknown and feel that it may somehow hold key information or insights that are pieces to a larger puzzle that can help them better understand the universe and their place in it even just a teeny bit better. This is someone who appreciates complex and intricate systems with many small details that fit together to make a whole, but that can be taken apart piece by piece for further analysis. Whenever they are feeling down they may come to astrology and read about themselves (and sometimes others because they learn about themselves through their relationships with others) to get a renewed perspective and sense of their strengths and weaknesses and how they can use this information to empower them. They might pull a tarot card here and there when they want some insight on the direction they’re going or if they’re feeling lost and need to check in with themselves to see if their goals are aligning with their actions. They are very aware of the possibility of all of this being horseshit but to them it holds meaning as a tool (for self-discovery) they can use to repeatedly ask themselves questions and grow. It also holds a sense of magic that this person has always been drawn to. This person loves stories with magic and the mystical, with mystery, everything related to the paranormal, other dimensions, metaphysics, dreams etc. They love music- especially smooth and dreamy ethereal sounds but they have an appreciation for all sounds (except modern country…yuck! ). They want to learn to play the guitar desperately. Their favorite clothes are hoodies, jeans, converse- classic and simple attire for the millennial. They’re vegan, not because meat doesn’t taste good but because they believe all animals have personalities and preferences and don’t want to contribute to violence in any form if possible. It’s about greatly reducing their impact not perfection. They love mysteries and british shows- british comedy, mysteries and the great british bake off of course. They have always had a love for cats even tho they also love dogs, they just spent more time observing cat behavior and understand them a little better. They didn’t get their first pet until they were 15, their cat Daisy, who is now 15. Their personality is sarcastic and maybe a bit cold seeming from the outside but theyre very sensitive and empathetic on the inside. I just realized I wrote way too many sentences hahaha. </p>
