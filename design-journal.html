        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: Ever since the days of Myspace, where I would have a blast changing my background, making my photos scroll across the screen, prompting snowflakes to fall and music to start playing, I have been inspired to get into learning how to code and learn html/css and just anything/ everything relevant to building and designing websites. I'm interested to know more about the difference of ux design compared to ui design and where the type of coding we are learning right now falls in. I am excited for this class and already having a lot of fun. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project one I am planning on creating five webpages related to astrology. I have an interest in the subject that goes deeper than sun sign astrology and I just think it's a really great tool for self discovery, reflection and growth. I am making the main web page be the title page of 'Astrology' with four links to the four webpages I will create that will be 1. Signs, 2. Houses, 3. Planets, and 4. Elements. I am also planning on linking a site where you can enter your birth information into a birth chart calculator to get your birth chart (a snapshot of the sky at the moment you were born) and that will be on the main webpage. On each of the webpages there will be short and concise descriptions of whatever that page is covering- so all the signs, all the planets, all the houses, all of the elements, as well as a short description of what each of them mean for your birth chart. I'm having a little difficulty making all the pages unique looking from one another, since they're mostly about relaying information and theres a good amount of it. I will try to play around with color and make the pages unique in that regard. I am going to be incorporating some starry space images to tie together with the stars and sky vibe and I am looking for a clean sans serif font that has a almost futuristic type vibe- as I feel that the idea of space conjures up ideas of the future and the unknown and I think astrology fits into that realm.   </p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
        <p>Response: The person who visits my site wants to learn more about astrology because they’re drawn to the occult and the unknown and feel that it may somehow hold key information or insights that are pieces to a larger puzzle that can help them better understand the universe and their place in it even just a teeny bit better. This is someone who appreciates complex and intricate systems with many small details that fit together to make a whole, but that can be taken apart piece by piece for further analysis. Whenever they are feeling down they may come to astrology and read about themselves (and sometimes others because they learn about themselves through their relationships with others) to get a renewed perspective and sense of their strengths and weaknesses and how they can use this information to empower them. They might pull a tarot card here and there when they want some insight on the direction they’re going or if they’re feeling lost and need to check in with themselves to see if their goals are aligning with their actions. They are very aware of the possibility of all of this being horseshit but to them it holds meaning as a tool (for self-discovery) they can use to repeatedly ask themselves questions and grow. It also holds a sense of magic that this person has always been drawn to. This person loves stories with magic and the mystical, with mystery, everything related to the paranormal, other dimensions, metaphysics, dreams etc. They love music- especially smooth and dreamy ethereal sounds but they have an appreciation for all sounds (except modern country…yuck! ). They want to learn to play the guitar desperately. Their favorite clothes are hoodies, jeans, converse- classic and simple attire for the millennial. They’re vegan, not because meat doesn’t taste good but because they believe all animals have personalities and preferences and don’t want to contribute to violence in any form if possible. It’s about greatly reducing their impact not perfection. They love mysteries and british shows- british comedy, mysteries and the great british bake off of course. They have always had a love for cats even tho they also love dogs, they just spent more time observing cat behavior and understand them a little better. They didn’t get their first pet until they were 15, their cat Daisy, who is now 15. Their personality is sarcastic and maybe a bit cold seeming from the outside but theyre very sensitive and empathetic on the inside. I just realized I wrote way too many sentences hahaha. </p>

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Considering these articles, make a list of 5 things to keep you going when you feel resistance or discomfort.</p>
        <p>Response: Five things to keep me going when I'm feeling resistance or discomfort would have to be: <br> 
          <br>
          1. to remember that I cannot grow without stepping into an area that is beyond my comfort zone, this especially applies to learning something new and developing a skill. When I was learning to draw, I was very discouraged in the beginning with the art work I created. I thought it was ugly and childish looking and it made me want to give up, until I changed my outlook and thought, "I don't care anymore, I want to draw and I will just keep drawing ugly people and animals and I am fine with drawing these ugly people and animals for the rest of my days." And that really ended up taking the pressure off and getting rid of the expectation that I should be drawing anything else. I slowly got better at drawing, each time I learned something new from a drawing and I was encouraged when I looked at my drawings from the beginning compared to the ones I was producing later on. I now realize much later that ugly people and animals are still art and that art is subjective and they can bring as much joy as naturalistic or "realistic" looking art. I actually prefer the ugly drawings now lol.</p>
          <br>
          2. to remember that when learning new things, it is just part of the process to feel embarrased and incompetent. Nobody starts out an expert. You've got to be willing to look like a fool to get places. And you'll be happy that you did.</p>
          <br>
          3. to be kind and patient with myself and give myself extra love, care and understanding. And like the articles mentioned, to know that it takes bravery to step out of a place of comfort into the unknown and take a shot in the dark. It's easy and safe to be a boat tied to a dock, but the real adventure is in the open, scary, magnificent seas. </p>
          <br>
          4. to be aware of my natural inclination towards resistance and procrastination when faced with doing something that is out of my comfort zone. It's easy for me to spiral into a pattern of negative self talk and tell myself that I can't do something or I'll never be good at it, and to procrastinate because of these limiting beliefs but awareness of them gives me some power back and can help me to tell that roommate in my head, "thanks nancy for your concern, but I'm ok and I'm gonna go code now because I'm an intelligent, funny and cool human and I can do this, some way, somehow." </p>
         <br>
         5. the knowledge that I'm not alone and that many other people have gone through the same feelings in order to expand their worlds in a great and empowering way.

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Why did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? What bothers you about them? How will you improve things in your own design?</p>
        <p>Response: I chose DC Vegetarian because I thought their website was a little bland and could use some brighter colors and a new look. I also love their sandwiches. I will focus on making the site have a more welcoming vibe that is more visually appealing and makes you want to visit the place. Specifically with a new color palette, more photos to show what the food and vibe of the place is like, more appealing typography choices to compliment the overall design. The two websites that I looked at that are similar are, Eastside Delicatessen and Off the Griddle. I think Eastside sandwiches site is well organized so that you can easily find the information you’re looking for, but it has too commercial a feel for my taste. Off the Griddle’s site is very visually pleasing, you can easily find what you’re looking for and the cohesive design of everything- color palette, typography, etc makes you want to linger. I also like the interaction on the top of the page with a slideshow of photos of the place and food. I may try to incorporate that type of interaction on my own site. I'm also realizing, now that I've started coding, that my design is changing from what I had previously planned in my design comps simply because I think I'm finding better design solutions/ looks and I'm not sure if that's an ok thing to do (to stray from your originally planned design compositions) or a not great thing? :O  </p>

        <h2>Week Eight</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Read this article on mobile-first design and share your thoughts on mobile-first vs desktop first.</p>
        <p>Response: 
          I think that it makes sense to start from a “mobile first” or progressive advancement approach. Like the article mentioned, there are now people spending more time online with the use of their mobile phones than on desktops. There are also more mobile phones being bought than computers/ laptops. It is more accessible for people to quickly visit websites on their phones on the go, wherever they may be. I think it makes sense especially compared to designing for desktop first or from a graceful degradation approach because like the article mentioned, you end up making an awesome website and then as a sort of afterthought- or so it may appear- you design a mobile version that ends up being a watered-down version of the awesome desktop version. Designing from a mobile first approach allows you to streamline your design and really get concise and neat designs with exactly what you need to show off a product and nothing more or less. You can then add some features and interactions that the desktop version will allow without having the mobile version of your site suffer. And this is important because there may be a lot more people seeing the mobile version than the desktop version.

        <h2>Week Nine</h2>
        <p>Prompt: This one's about "why." Read this article (try to pretend it's not a cheezy article about business success). Spend some time thinking about why you are pursuing a career in design. Really dig down, do the 7 "whys" tool in the article. OR If that's too challenging right now, consider people in your life or people who've inspired you. Think about what drives them, what their "why" is. Why did they work so hard to do XYZ, was it from past experiences they had, was it because they saw a need they were called to fill? What's their deeper "why?" Ask them if you know them, or look up some biographical information and try to figure it out. Write about either you or your inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>Response: My why for being in college started out being something I did because I felt an expectation from others (my family mostly). I didn’t love high school so I was apprehensive about going back to an environment that didn’t make me feel good. I started at pcc when I was nineteen and took a variety of part time classes for a long time not knowing what I wanted to do. I was happy to find out that pcc was nothing like high school and I was actually sad to leave when I transferred to psu. In 2016 I took a drawing class and rediscovered how much I love drawing and creating. I had spent a lot of time as a child drawing and coloring but art disappeared from my life as I became a teenager. I’ve been drawing pretty consistently since then. There will be a few months here and there when I don’t draw or paint because I’m consumed with responsibilities but I never go too long before I return to it. I decided I wanted to do graphic design because at first, it felt like the most reasonable choice where I could make a living and still have some sense of art at the center of my life. During the journey, I’ve found I love telling stories, designing, and creating illustrations and other elements to aid in the final result. And coding has been a new joy and utter frustration but also sort of like an itch I have to scratch because nothing feels better than refreshing a webpage to see that whatever thing you’ve been trying to make work for an hour is finally where it’s supposed to be.</p>
