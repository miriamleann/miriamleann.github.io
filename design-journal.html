        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: Ever since the days of Myspace, where I would have a blast changing my background, making my photos scroll across the screen, prompting snowflakes to fall and music to start playing, I have been inspired to get into learning how to code and learn html/css and just anything/ everything relevant to building and designing websites. I'm interested to know more about the difference of ux design compared to ui design and where the type of coding we are learning right now falls in. I am excited for this class and already having a lot of fun. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project one I am planning on creating five webpages related to astrology. I have an interest in the subject that goes deeper than sun sign astrology and I just think it's a really great tool for self discovery, reflection and growth. I am making the main web page be the title page of 'Astrology' with four links to the four webpages I will create that will be 1. Signs, 2. Houses, 3. Planets, and 4. Elements. I am also planning on linking a site where you can enter your birth information into a birth chart calculator to get your birth chart (a snapshot of the sky at the moment you were born) and that will be on the main webpage. On each of the webpages there will be short and concise descriptions of whatever that page is covering- so all the signs, all the planets, all the houses, all of the elements, as well as a short description of what each of them mean for your birth chart. I'm having a little difficulty making all the pages unique looking from one another, since they're mostly about relaying information and theres a good amount of it. I will try to play around with color and make the pages unique in that regard. I am going to be incorporating some starry space images to tie together with the stars and sky vibe and I am looking for a clean sans serif font that has a almost futuristic type vibe- as I feel that the idea of space conjures up ideas of the future and the unknown and I think astrology fits into that realm.   </p>
